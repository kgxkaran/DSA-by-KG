ðŸ“Œ DSA + Interview Smart Practice Tips
Question solve karte waqt ye soch:

=> Iska brute force kya hoga?
=> or konsi Better approach hoskati hai?
=> Optimized ka time/space kya hoga?

" Explain your logic line by line "

*imagine you are giving an interview whenever solving any question
*discuss and communicate the solution(brute,better,optimized) with yourself/or your friend or can also discuss with gpt
*Also recognize the Patterns (We will be solving patterwise questions as well)
*you must know how to calculate the Time-Space complexity of your code
*Always follow Brute->Better->Optimal soltuions 

Saath me har problem ke baad
"Iska Time/Space kya hai?"
